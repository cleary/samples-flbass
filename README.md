# samples-flbass
Fretless bass samples - tuned to C with various attacks styles, releases, positions and harmonics

These were developed with the intent to use in tidalcycles, I strongly recommend checking out to an existing samples folder sourced by supercollider as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/cleary/samples-flbass.git /path/to/samples-folder/flbass
```

then restart supercollider
